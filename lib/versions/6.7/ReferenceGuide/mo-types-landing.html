<h1>Managed Object Types Overview</h1>

<p>
The VMware vSphere management object model is a complex system of data structures designed to provision, manage, monitor, and control the life-cycle of all components that can possibly comprise virtual infrastructure. The VMware vSphere management architecture is patterned after Java&#146;s JMX (Java Management Extensions) infrastructure in which objects are used to instrument other objects, on a remote server. The data structures defined for the object model include both managed object types, as described on this page, and <a href="do-types-landing.html">data object types</a>. 
</p>

<p>
A &#147;<strong>managed object type</strong>&#148; is a core data structure of the server-side object model. Instances of various managed object types are referred to generically as &#147;managed objects,&#148; of which there are two broad categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Managed objects that extend the <a href="vim.ManagedEntity.html">ManagedEntity</a> managed object type, and thus, are components that comprise the <strong>inventory</strong> of virtual components. For example, instances of host systems (<a href="vim.HostSystem.html">HostSystem</a>), virtual machines (<a href="vim.VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a>, and datastores (<a href="vim.Datastore.html">Datastore</a>) are inventoried objects, and are referred to generically as &#147;managed entities.&#148;</li>
<li>Managed objects that provide services for the entire system. Managed objects in this category enable managing performance (<a href="vim.PerformanceManager.html">PerformanceManager</a>), managing licenses for VMware products (LicenseManager), and managing virtual storage (<a href="vim.VirtualDiskManager.html">VirtualDiskManager</a>). These managed objects are the service interfaces for the virtual infrastructure management components.</li>
</ul>
<p>Managed objects can contain both <a href="properties-landing.html">properties</a> and <a href="methods-landing.html">operations</a>. An &#147;operation&#148; is Web-services terminology for what might be called a &#147;method&#148; in other programming languages, such as Java. In fact, the word &#147;method&#148; is used in the API Reference rather than operation, but you may see the two words used, interchangeably. 
</p>

<p>Regardless of these subtle language differences,
working with the server from a client involves a few common steps,
starting with connecting to the server,
authenticating user-account credentials, and obtaining a session.
(See the vSphere Web Services SDK Programming Guide for details).
</p>

<p>
After connecting to the server system, the client application must then obtain a <strong>reference</strong> to the <a href="vim.ServiceInstance.html">ServiceInstance</a> managed object. This figure shows the <a href="vim.ServiceInstance.html">ServiceInstance</a> and some of its associated <a href="do-types-landing.html">data objects</a>. (In this figure, the property names are not shown: only the data type of the associated property).

<p>The &#147;<strong>MOR</strong>&#148; in the figure above is an abbreviation
for <a href="vmodl.ManagedObjectReference.html">ManagedObjectReference</a>,
a <a href="do-types-landing.html">data object</a> type that provides
a reference to server-side objects for use by client applications.
See the vSphere Web Services SDK Programming Guide for more information.
